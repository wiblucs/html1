<!--Lucas Wibben 9/17/2021 -->
<!--I took a lot of my layout design towards national geographic. I thought that the layout was very nice and simple and easy to work with. Im not going for like an exact replica of the website but something similar.-->
<!--National Geographic: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/ -->
<!--My intended audience is people looking for interesing articles or news or travel, I just want it to be sort of like and exploring kind of site with some other features -->
<!-- Some goals I want for my website is for it to be fairly simple for it to use. I dont want too much on the screen, I just want a simple website with information. -->
<!--Question 1: I chose this color scheme since it was sort of like a desert type of feeling color which was what I was going for -->
<!--Question 2: these are the hexa values for my colors #FCF3CF #E6BF25 -->
<!--Question 3: Im only using 2 colors as of now, most likely will change later when I can blend them better.-->
<!--Question 4: I just went for a basic font (times new roman) this is my favorite font I just think it looks the cleanest out of all fonts so thats why I chose this font for everything. subject to change though -->
<!--Question 5: Some text is bolded such as the headers and I have the text boxes just normal text. -->

			<p>Tigers have recently been on a rapid decline in population which caused them to be considered endangered. <br>
			About a century ago their were around 100,000 tigers in all of asia, now, their are only around 3,900. 
			This decline is a result of illegal hunting and trade of tigers.</p>
