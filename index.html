<h3 style="text-align:center">The Endangered Tigers</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">Tigers have recently been on a rapid decline in population which caused them to be considered endangered. <br>
About a century ago their were around 100,000 tigers in all of asia, now, their are only around 3,900. 
This decline is a result of illegal hunting and trade of tigers.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Travel</h1>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Exploring Europe.</h4>
<img src="images/europe.jpg" alt="Picture of europe" width = "500" height="300"/>

<p style="text-align:center">There are a countless amount of great locations to visit in europe, whihch is why its important to see the right ones. <br>
The first location ou should see is the eiffel tower, its good for any age. It is an amazing sight, with many shops around as well.<br>
 Another location you should visit is Iceland. This is more of a nature route rather than the typical vaction city. <br>
You will see valcanoes and glaciers and many other amazing sights. <br>
The last place I recommend is Greece. This is more of a historical place with some great attractions such as the colleseum. <br>
So if you are into a location with more history this is the perfect place for you.</p>
